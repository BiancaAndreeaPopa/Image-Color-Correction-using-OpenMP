# Image-Color-Correction-using-OpenMP

Project Requirements/Theme:

Algorithm: Utilization of a parallel method for color correction of an image.
Programming Languages: C++, OpenMP.
Libraries Used: SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for image manipulation.
Development Platform: Visual Studio Code (or preferred editor), with extensions for C++ and OpenMP.

Experimental Results:
Image Used: "image1.jpg" and "crocus-1279508_1280.png"
Color Correction: +50 red, +100 green, -50 blue
Resultant Image: "output_image_parallel.jpg"
